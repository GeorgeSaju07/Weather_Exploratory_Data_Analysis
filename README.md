🌦️ **Weather Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Weather dataset. The project aims to uncover meaningful patterns from atmospheric variables such as Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, Day, and Temperature through statistical exploration and data visualization.

📂 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to:

Clean and preprocess raw weather data

Understand data distributions and statistical properties

Explore variable relationships and seasonal patterns

Visualize trends affecting weather and air-quality indicators

Derive insights related to ozone formation and weather patterns


📊 **Key Insights**

Temperature & Solar Radiation positively influence Ozone levels, meaning ozone tends to increase on warm, sunny days.

Wind Speed has a strong negative correlation with Ozone, indicating that wind disperses ozone and improves air quality.

Weak or no correlation between Day index and other variables, showing temporal index alone does not influence atmospheric parameters.

Sunny, hot, low-wind days typically show higher ozone concentration.


📈 **Visualizations Included**

Distribution plots

Boxplots & Outlier detection

Heatmap correlation matrix

Trend line charts

Pairplots


📥 **Dataset Source**

Public weather data sourced for educational and research purposes.


🚀 **Future Enhancements**

Add machine learning model for ozone prediction

Include seasonal analysis and decomposition

Deploy interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI)
